# d&d 5e encounter builder

d&d-5e-encounter-builder is a terminal-based interactive D&D 5E encounter builder and combat tracker written in Python 3. I developed this tool because I could not find an existing combat tracker that would allow me to reroll initiative for all characters every combat round as I think that makes the game more interesting. It current supports features such as encounter save/load, add and bulk add of monsters and presaved encounters, combatant stat editing and display, a spell search system allowing filtering by name, class, level, type, etc. and many more.

The only dependency is the tabulate table library.
 
This documentation is a work in progress that I intend to improve, please forgive me for its current limtiations. Consult my original "design.txt" to see my original design document that the project likely doesn't conform to but it should provide basic guidance. The "help" command currently lists all available features and describes their use. 

This is a project I worked on last year (April 2022) that I have resurrected and decided to make public. I hope someone finds it useful for their own GMing. Contributions and feature requests welcome.
